            To start, we looked at how Swift Testingâ€™s APIs help you write expressive tests. With parameterization, you can exercise many different cases with a single test.

            Tools such as suites and tags help you organize and document your test code.

            And finally, testing in parallel can reduce the time it takes to run your tests and may help identify dependencies between them.
